## 📖 About the Project

### A website where you have to guess the function only by looking at the graph
- ### **Features :**
    - **Various levels of difficulties**
    - **Level saving**

## 📝 Rules
### To play the Functions Game, here are some important rules:

**Spaces and capital letters are not taken into account in the response.<br>
For example, sin(x) is equivalent to SIN (X ).**

**Use the computer syntax for functions. Here are some examples :**
> x*2 for multiplication.<br>
x/2 for division.<br>
x^y for x to the power of y.<br>
sqrt(x) for the square root.<br>
sin(x) for sine.<br>
cos(x) for the cosine.<br>
tan(x) for the tangent.<br>
exp(x) for the exponential.<br>
ln(x) for the logarithm.<br>
abs(x) for the absolute value.<br> )_

**Answers can be given in any order respecting the
basic mathematical rules, so : x * 5 = 5 * x  but: 1/x ≠ x/1.**
